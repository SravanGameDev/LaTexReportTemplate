\Large Prototype a game requires a lot of time if it is a graphical based so it requires time to build the locality. The cost of production increases if it had to do it manual. There are any tools to check the 3d model which are random placed with the rules of theirs. L system give flexibility of choose their own rules and randomize their generation of the models in the layout.

This system works with user defined where can be changed and modified with the values, it gives the 3d artist to experiment their models with the environment. The models are mapped based on the road generation through the L system model.
