\Large The procedural generation of roads is generated with the L Systems where rules are used to create random roads. The roads are mapped with the based on the 3 way, 4 way and road ends \cite{galin2010procedural}.The algorithm divides the string into the characters where every character represents the road layout and its orientation the game world.

\Large Based on the survey of the procedural cites and roads \cite{de2011survey} \cite{kelly2006survey} the data and structure is taken from them to create system to create the trees and buildings. The helper functions which are used to instantiate the object in the game with the L system model.
