\section*{Brief}
1. You propose and realise a project in small teams (normally 2 or 3 students per team from the module). If you cannot (easily) form a group, contact me by email with your preferred topic.\newline \newline
2. You only need ONE submission PER GROUP.\newline \newline
3. Do put a READ ME.text saying : who (else)is on the team, title of project.\newline \newline
4. A link to your code repository will be just fine (e.g. on a GitHub space).\newline \newline
5. One video per group: a link to Vimeo/YouTube/etc. is fine; uploading your video (unless very large) should be possible too on the VLE.\newline \newline
6.Video can be short (e.g. 30 secs); one minute is likely plenty; longer ones should have a good narrative. (think: can I re-use this for my portfolio?)\newline \newline
7.Report (one per group): recommended you use a LaTeX format/tool (e.g. LyX, TeX maker, Overleaf, etc.), but you may use your favorite word processor of course. Should have the following parts/sections as a minimum:\newline \newline

\section*{Structure of the Report}
1. Title page (with at least names, course title/number, project title, date, logo or illustrative picture/teaser)\newline \newline
2. Introduction\newline \newline
3. Background : other works related to yours? summary/brief historical view on the subject (as  it relates to graphics or games or computing/maths).\newline \newline
4. Method: your work, description, decisions made, goals.\newline \newline
5. Team : how the project was managed, share of work, tasks, interactions\newline \newline
6. Results (put some visuals; link (URL) to your video)\newline \newline
7. Discussion or Conclusion (problems encountered, lessons learned, ideas, future work/improvements/features, ...)\newline \newline
8. Bibliography (at least 5 solid references).\newline \newline
9. Appendices : optional (more visuals, pseudo code, architecture, UI details, etc.)\newline \newline
10. NB : Teams details (members, selected topics) will appear later on.\newline
